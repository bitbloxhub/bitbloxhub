i like github, python, IRC, gopher, RISC-V, ethereum, IPFS, and tor

i think websites should not have tracking or popups, but thinks that **YOUR** html, **YOUR** css, and **YOUR** javascript (without frameworks or librarys) should be how **YOUR** website is made and **YOUR** site should use github apis and **YOUR** site should be hosted on github pages
