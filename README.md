i like github, webdev, tor, and RISC-V

i think websites should not have tracking or popups, but thinks that **YOUR** html, **NO** css, and **NO** javascript should be how **YOUR** website is made and **YOUR** site should use **YOUR** post request forms and **YOUR** site should be hosted on **YOUR** computer
